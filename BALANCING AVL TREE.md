# Experiment 16E: Balancing AVL Tree

## Aim
To write a Python program to construct an AVL tree, balance it, and print the nodes of the tree before and after balancing using the appropriate packages and built-in functions.

---

## Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Define `getDictTree(self)` to return the dictionary representation of the AVL tree.
3. Define `Construct_AVL(L)` to:
   - Create the AVL tree from the list `L`.
   - Print the tree before balancing.
   - Balance the tree using the `BalanceTree()` method.
   - Print the tree after balancing.
4. Create a list `L` of integers.
5. Call `Construct_AVL(L)` to build and balance the tree.
6. End the program.

---

## Program

```
from TreeAVL.AVL import AVL



def getDictTree(self):
 return self.dict_tree

def Construct_AVL(L):
  tree = AVL(L)
  print("AVL Tree Before Balancing\n",getDictTree(tree))
  tree.BalanceTree()
  print("AVL Tree After Balancing\n",getDictTree(tree))


L=[11,8,18,5,13,17,4,7,2]

```

## RESULT
Thus the python program was initialised and executed successfully.
